# What is jControl?

jControl is a clone of jQuery, and is a library that enables a user to manipulate the Document Object Model. This library is written with vanilla JavaScript, and its functions are specifically written using the DOM api.

# How does jControl work?

In order to begin manipulating the DOM, the user needs to pass a string referring to an HTML element or an actual HTML element into the $l() function. Once the proper argument has been passed into $l(), then all of the functions on its prototype are available to the user.

The methods include:

1.) .html
2.) .empty
3.) .append
4.) .attr
5.) .addClass
6.) .removeClass
7.) .children
8.) .parent
9.) .find
10.) .remove
11.) .on
12.) .off
